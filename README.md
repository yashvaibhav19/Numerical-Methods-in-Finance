# Numerical-Methods-in-Finance
In my quest to understand Mark Joshi and Steven Shreve I inaugurate this repository containing my personal solutions, implementations, and notes from the book "Numerical Methods in Finance with C++" by Maciej J. Capi≈Ñski and Tomasz Zastawniak.  

The original C++ code among other resources can be looked up [here](www.cambridge.org/9781107003712).
